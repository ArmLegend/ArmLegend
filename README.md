### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chokchai
- I'm a person who doesn't use social media anymore.
- I love spending my time learning new things, especially in DevOps and Cloud.
- My favorite programming language is Go (2024 is for Go, tbh).
- Walking in the park is one of my favorite activities.
- I also write a blog mainly about DevOps and Cloud technology.
